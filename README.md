## Data Files

### Input Files
- **athal_wu_0_A.bam**: Binary Alignment/Map file containing aligned sequencing reads
- **athal_wu_0_A.bam.bai**: Index file for the BAM file (required for efficient access)
- **athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf**: Gene Transfer Format file containing gene annotations

### File Descriptions
- **BAM file**: Contains aligned short reads from Arabidopsis thaliana sequencing
- **GTF file**: Contains gene structure annotations including exons, introns, and gene boundaries
- **BAI file**: Binary index file that enables fast random access to the BAM file

## Usage

This project is designed for genomic data analysis workflows. The data files can be used with tools such as:
- SAMtools for BAM file manipulation
- Bedtools for genomic interval operations
- R/Bioconductor packages for genomic analysis
- Python libraries like pysam for BAM file processing

## Requirements

To work with these files, you'll need:
- SAMtools for BAM file operations
- Bedtools for genomic interval analysis
- R or Python with appropriate genomic analysis packages

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the data directory
3. Use the genomic data files with your preferred analysis tools
