# Genomic Data Science Project

**Johns Hopkins University - Data Science Course Project**

This repository contains genomic data analysis files and tools for processing Arabidopsis thaliana sequencing data. As part of a larger project cataloging genetic variation in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we sequenced and assembled the genome of one strain ('wu_0_A'), then mapped back the reads to the assembled genome. The resulting BAM file is included in the package 'gencommand_proj2_data.tar.gz'. Using SAMtools and BEDtools as well as other Unix commands introduced in this course, we examine the files to analyze genetic variation patterns.

**Note:** Input data have been obtained and modified from those generated by the 1001 Genomes Project, accession 'Wu_0_A'.

- **region_subset.bam**: Subset of BAM file for specific genomic region analysis
- **region_subset.bam.bai**: Index file for the region subset
- **overlaps.bed**: Results from overlap analysis between reads and annotations
- **lengths**: Data file containing length analysis results

### Project 2 Files (data_p2/)
- **wu_0.v7.fas**: FASTA format genome assembly file for the Wu_0 strain
- **wu_0_A_wgs.fastq**: Whole genome sequencing reads in FASTQ format

### File Descriptions
- **BAM file**: Contains aligned short reads from Arabidopsis thaliana sequencing
- **GTF file**: Contains gene structure annotations including exons, introns, and gene boundaries
- **BAI file**: Binary index file that enables fast random access to the BAM file
- **FASTA file**: Contains the genome assembly sequence in FASTA format

## Usage

This project is designed for analyzing genetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana using genomic data analysis workflows. The primary analysis involves:

- **SAMtools** for BAM file manipulation and read analysis
- **BEDtools** for genomic interval operations and feature analysis
- **Bowtie2** for sequence alignment to reference genome
- **Unix command line tools** for data processing and file manipulation
- **R/Bioconductor packages** for genomic analysis 
- **Python libraries** like pysam for BAM file processing 

### Docker Environment
To run the analysis in a controlled environment:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /Users/labuser3/Downloads/genomic_data_science:/workspace gencommand_image:v1.0.0 /bin/bash
```

The main goal is to examine genetic variation patterns in the Wu_0_A strain by analyzing mapped sequencing reads against the assembled genome.

## Requirements

To work with these files, you'll need:
- **SAMtools** for BAM file operations and read analysis
- **BEDtools** for genomic interval analysis and feature comparisons
- **Bowtie2** for sequence alignment
- **Unix/Linux command line environment** for file manipulation and data processing
- **R or Python** with appropriate genomic analysis packages (optional for advanced analysis)
- **Docker** for running the analysis environment (optional)
